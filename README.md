# Engine

This is my first try at creating a 2D game engine library in JavaScript based on the Canvas API.

Through creating this 2D game engine library from scratch, this project will help me hone my software design skills along with pushing me to explore the limits of the Canvas API for rendering 2D graphics.

You can find an in-depth look at my day-to-day progress on the project on my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/snarr_dev)
