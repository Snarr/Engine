Based on the popular iOS game 'Flappy Bird' by Dong Nguyen, this program was the first example created to test the game engine. Developing this program alongside the engine helped me explore the initial design of the codebase and key design decisions like: 

- Would I use JavaScript or TypeScript? 
- Would I use Constructor Functions or Classes?
- What would be responsible for drawing Sprites, a Canvas object or the Sprite object?

The program also forced me to develop new library features like an Input class for keyboard inputs and Collision Detection between Sprites.
